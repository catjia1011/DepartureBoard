# Departure Board

Departure Board is an iOS widget that allows you to view the departure boards of some specific MTR stations at the same time.

Currently it's designed for LOHAS Park residents to wait for next train at home, and to arrive at target station in time when a "To LOHAS Park" train appears.

Currently only Tseung Kwan O Line is supported. More line support and features are coming in future.

## Installation

Download the code and install CocoaPods. Then run `pod install`. See details: <https://cocoapods.org>.

## Usage

Install the app to your iPhone and enable it in the widget screen.
